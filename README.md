In the Spotify Analysis repo, I will be pushing 2 collab files,
1. is a very simple ML logistic regression model that is used to predict whether the user will like the songs depending on the dataset we have regarding the user's likes. It will be altered soon as the accuracy is as low as 75%.
2. would be the genre classification, which will be up soon :)
